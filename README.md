bonnie-parser
=============

This repo here contains scripts to execute, Python and bash shell parsers for performance tests from within VMs on MOS environment.

No detailed documentation exists yet. Consilt scripts for inline comments ;)

Typical flow is to execute preparation to create all of the needed volumes and then execute the actual test. After that folder with collected output from multiple bonnie++ processes can be passed to corresponding parsers to create some spreadsheets with report.
